# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules

## 📘 Overview
This project applies **Market Basket Analysis** on a real-world retail transaction dataset using the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover frequently bought product combinations and generate **association rules**. These insights help in product bundling, personalized recommendations, and sales strategy optimization.

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Dataset:** `online_retail.csv`  
- **Type:** E-commerce transaction data

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Identify frequently purchased product sets.
- Generate strong association rules using **Apriori**.
- Discover valuable product relationships to support cross-selling.
- Visualize the top rules for easier business interpretation.

## 🔁 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded data using `pandas`.
- Removed missing values and filtered invalid transactions (e.g., negative quantities).
- Limited analysis to transactions from the **United Kingdom**.
- Converted transactional data into a **basket matrix** format for rule mining.

### 2. **Frequent Itemset Mining**
- Used `mlxtend.apriori()` with `min_support=0.01` to find frequent itemsets.
- Extracted combinations of products purchased together with statistical significance.

### 3. **Association Rule Generation**
- Applied `association_rules()` with filters:
  - **Confidence > 50%**
  - **Lift > 1.2**
- Calculated metrics: support, confidence, and lift for each rule.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Created a **bar plot** showing top 10 rules by lift, annotated with support and confidence.
- Used `textwrap` and `matplotlib` to handle long item names cleanly.
- (Optional) Generated a **network graph** of top product associations using `networkx`.

### 💡 Interpretation
- Products with **similar themes or designs** (e.g., "Retrospot", "Spaceboy") are often bought together.
- **High lift values** (e.g., >2.0) suggest these co-purchases are non-random and highly valuable for targeting.
